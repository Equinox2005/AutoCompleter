This autocompleter engine was built mainly through the use of DLB Tries as its main data structures, which was done to optimize runtime. This autocompleter by default was fed the english dictionary, so when the App.java is ran it functions on English words only
Gradle was used to test the functionality of the program while I was developing/debugging it
